### Verify java is working and is in $PATH ###
```java -version``` 

```javac -version```

```javap -version```

Friendly advice: These should be the same version, or you might have a bad time :) 

### Compiling fun with javac and java###
- Open a terminal. Navigate to any folder whatsoever. Make a new Empty.java file. Try to compile it with javac. See what happens.
- Make a class named Program. Try to compile it with javac.
- Rename the class to Empty. Compile it. 
- Make a main method. Make it print "Hello world!". Compile it and run it.
- Make the main method print its arguments (String[] args). Make the for loop as you would make one in C or C++, and use the System.out.println method for printing to the console.

### Disassembly with javap ###
- Disassemble Empty.class
- That is what Eclipse is doing
